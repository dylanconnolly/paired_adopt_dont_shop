        <h3>No More Puppy Mills</h3>
        <p>
          We are against the practice of rapidly breeding dogs for sale. Our shelters consist of pups, 
          young and old, who are looking for a home and a second chance. They are previously abandoned, 
          abused, and forgotten. But with your help, they can have another chance of finding a new loving home.

        <h3>1.) Find</h3>
        <p>
          Sort through thousands of wonderful pets. See their photo, read about them, and when you're ready
          apply to adopt them.
        </p>

      <article class="instruction-block">
        <h3>2.) Adopt</h3>
        <p>
          The adoption process is simple and straightforward. Just fill out a form, answer a few questions,
          and your application will be added to the pool.
        </p>

      <article class="instruction-block">
        <h3>3.) Love</h3>
        <p>
          Once your adoption goes through you will be notified and a pick-up date will be scheduled
          to pick up the newest member of your family!
